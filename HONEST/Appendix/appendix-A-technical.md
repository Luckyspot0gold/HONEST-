# Appendix A — Technical Foundations

## Harmonic Reference  
A base harmonic reference frequency of 432 Hz is used as a normalization anchor for deterministic translation.

## Signal Processing  
- Time-series data is converted to frequency-domain representations.  
- Confidence scoring measures alignment between observed spectra and expected harmonic templates.

## Determinism  
All translation mappings are mathematically fixed and reproducible.

## Accessibility Guarantees  
All outputs are designed to meet or exceed WCAG AA++ standards.
