# H.O.N.E.S.T. Core Specification v2.1

## Abstract  
H.O.N.E.S.T. establishes the first open standard for verified multi-sensory economic truth, enabling real-time market data to be perceived through synchronized audio, haptic, and visual outputs. The protocol addresses systemic accessibility exclusion and market data integrity failures by combining multi-oracle verification with deterministic sensory translation.

## 1. The Problem: Economic Truth Failure  
Modern financial systems suffer from two structural failures:  
1. Sensory exclusion caused by visual-only interfaces.  
2. Trust erosion due to opaque, manipulable data pipelines.  
These failures disproportionately impact blind, low-vision, neurodivergent, and underserved populations.

---

## 2. First Principles  
H.O.N.E.S.T. is governed by the following axioms:  
- **Verified Truth:** Data must be validated via independent consensus.  
- **Sensory Equivalence:** Information must be perceivable across modalities.  
- **Determinism:** Identical inputs must yield identical outputs.  
- **Non-Bias:** Translation must introduce no interpretive distortion.  
- **Public Utility Orientation:** Governance aligns with accessibility and equity.

## 3. Phase 1 Architecture (Production)

### 3.1 HONEST-CORE (Verification Layer)  
- Aggregates multiple trusted data sources.  
- Enforces quorum-based consensus.  
- Produces a confidence-scored HonestMetric.

### 3.2 HONEST-SENSE (Translation Layer)  
- Deterministic mapping of verified metrics into:  
  - Audio  
  - Haptics  
  - Visual signals  
- WCAG AA++ and ADA-aligned output guarantees.

### 3.3 Governance  
Protocol evolution is governed by the W.T.E.F. DAO under immutable constitutional constraints.

## 4. Accessibility Commitment  
H.O.N.E.S.T. is permanently committed to free and open access for underserved populations. Accessibility is not optional — it is foundational.

---

## 5. Status  
Phase 1 is live, functional, and undergoing security and validation testing.
